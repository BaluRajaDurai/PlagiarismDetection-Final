# PlagiarismDetection-Final

PlagiarismDetection is a full stack application in which the admin can create faculty accounts. The faculty members receive their credentials via email to log in. The faculty can then schedule tests for students based on their department. Students can log in and submit their handwritten test papers on the platform. Once the students have uploaded their test papers, the faculty can check for plagiarism for the assigned class and provide feedback to individual students
